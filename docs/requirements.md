Log Monitor Requirements
===================
----------

Features
-------------

- Allow user connect to remote server, select file to monitor
- Create Bookmark to storage current monitor log file
- Allow monitor multiple log file
- Add ability to monitor remote server by custom command.
- Add multi default parser for each program languages. Also allow user to customize parser
- Summary log file by *notice*, *debug*, *error* (or something else) with number be side. When explan any summary, allow click to jump to that line
- Allow user to map the log file to the source code. After mapped, when click any link-file on log file, open that file on default ide/editor
- Allow run on daemon, alert when found error occurred

New idea: I think we should make a tool like file zilla, then we make the file that chosen by user will be updated runtime.
+ please explain more details about "Custom Command" feature.
